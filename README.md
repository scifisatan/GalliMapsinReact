# Galli Maps Vector Plugin in React

##### using 3 file for context for hmr in vite to work properly but it is still bugging

Just wanted to try might not be worth the hassle to do all of this

might implement all of the apis in hooks for easier use later

Feedbacks/PRs are happily welcomed.
Would be fun to have a Galli Maps React Library (might be library agnostic as well) for easier implementation and adoption

dumb idea i gave up


i could not load the galli map script dynamically so initially i set it in index.html directly.

now i cannot initialize galli maps plugin object because it gives not defined error.

there might be other work around. or galli maps has to give me their backend access to make it happen.

either way good try, learned about react project architecture, custom hooks, useContext and all.

setting this repo public for someone to iterate and improve.
